My leetcode study guide
I interviewed at Google, FB, Microsoft, Uber and was never tested on a concept that I have not seen before.

Step 0 - You know how to code. (You can solve some Leetcode Easy Questions)
Credits: u/keanwood

Prereqs: You are comfortable with programming in general, and you can flesh out your thoughts via code. Go to codewars.com and do a few of their easiest problems (lv8 and lv7)

If you can't solve any Leetcode easy just keep revising easy questions. Easy questions do not require any algorithms except linear traversals and the likes.
Step 1 - Algo MOOC or book
This is what I used: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html

or this if you have time (avoid network flows): https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1 https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2

Just get to solving the actual questions as soon as you can. MOOC take a lot of time to complete and If you know the basic data structures and traversals, start step-2. If you do not know how to solve it (Which will be the case), look it up and upsolve.

I already knew my way around basic data structures and traversals so I stared from step 2.

For me BFS/DFS is basic while Dijkstra's is not.

Step 2 - Coderust

Search the questions on leetcode. I was not able to do most of them so please look at the answer and upsolve. This will give you a great base to solve other similar questions.

This should be enough for Tier 2 companies.
FAANG/BIG N
Step 3 - Teamblind List

In leetcode list format: https://leetcode.com/list/xoqag3yj/
Step 4 - A week before the interview
Company specific leetcode explore questions
Company tagged leetcode discuss

The hardest part for me was to come up with a proper plan as there are just so many questions and it's easy to get lost. Also please look at the solution if you can't solve it in 30 mins.

Followed this for 3 months and received internship offers from FB, Uber and Microsoft. Hope this helps you as well.

Good luck!

EDIT: Added a more descriptive step 0
